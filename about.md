In December 2017, I was asked to creatre a simple program to educate my daughter with the Filipino language.  during that time, almost every child get their entertainment on Youtube.  So I thought, I can take advantage of Youtube platform.  

I have acting experience and I am not really a writer.  Youtube is perfect for this!  I told myself, "I am going to be a Youtuber!"
